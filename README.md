# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
A visualization tool for those who want to know how the algorithms actually works.


## Overview

This Python project provides an interactive visualization of popular pathfinding algorithms using the Pygame library. It allows users to create custom mazes, set start and target points, and observe how the algorithms find the shortest path.

## Features

- Visualization of Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms.
- Customizable maze creation.
- Interactive GUI for setting start and target points.
- Option to toggle wall creation while visualizing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed.
- Pygame library installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Tirth-70/PathFinding_Pygames.git
   ```

### Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd pathfinding-visualization
```

### Install required Python packages:

```shell
pip install pygame
```

##Usage
### Run the Python script:

```shell
python pathfinding_visualization.py
```

### Use the following controls:

Left-click: Add/remove walls.
Right-click: Set start and target points.
"Maze" button: Generate random mazes.
"Reset" button: Clear the grid.
"T" key: Toggle wall creation.
"Diji" button: Start Dijkstra's algorithm.
"A*" button: Start the A* algorithm.
"Exit" button or closing the window to exit the program.
